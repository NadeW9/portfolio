Sample previous coding work

Code Decriptions ================

1) PYTHON
- CW Submission Final.py
  > A code to solve for the 2D wave equation via discretisation.
  > A 3D sine wave was used to model the solution in 3 dimensions.
  > Relevant surface and contour plots were generated to demonstrate the code.
  > Y2 Computing Module short project 2023 || university
- FashionODFinal.py
  > A training model for machine learning.
  > Computer vision is used to differentiate/identify various types of clothing from a given data set.
  > Specifically ['tops', 'trousers', 'outerwear', 'dresses', 'skirts'].
  > Team project for BrainHack competition 2020 || high school

2) ARDUINO (C&C++)
- EllipseControlMain.ino
  > Stepper motor control using TMC5160 driver.
  > Emulate a real hand tremor at selected frequency intervals.
  > Ellipsoidal velocity pattern, with maximum at centre.
  > Internship project 2022 || university
- BT_RemoteXY.ino
  > DIY personal project to control LEDs of a custom-made acrylic whiteboard.
  > Uses Bluetooth feature of ESP32 microcontroller to communicate with an app on my smartphone.
  > Used an open source interfacer RemoteXY to design the app.
  > Hobby project 2021 || university
- a) PImain.ino
  > Proportional and integral speed control for BLDC motors.
  > For a novel, independently designed robot module (MBOT_One) driven with 2 brushless DC motors.
  > Speed and steps control implemented with internal hall sensors, and feedback is provided by external absolute encoders.
  > Engineering research project 2019 || high school
- b) PWM_test
